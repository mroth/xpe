Package xpe contains experimental code for determining the number of
performance and efficiency cores ("P-Cores" and "E-Cores") on the runtime CPU
architecture.

CAVEATS: Currently only useful on Darwin (macOS) and associated Apple Silicon
hardware. Should be possible to add Linux functionality and support for the 12th
Gen ("Alder Lake") and beyond Intel processors, but I don't have the hardware to
test this. Collaborators desired!
